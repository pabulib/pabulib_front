  <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
    <li>Files are uploaded to a temporary area (tmp) and then analyzed by our <strong>Checker</strong>. The per-tile panel below shows the <em>Validation Report (Checker)</em>.</li>
    <li>Outcomes:
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-1 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Valid</strong> — file parsed successfully and is ready to upload to the main library.</li>
        <li><strong>Processed but invalid</strong> — file was parsed, but the Checker found issues (e.g., inconsistent metadata or schema problems). Review details under “Show details”.</li>
        <li><strong>Not processed</strong> — file was skipped (e.g., not a .pb file, cannot be parsed, or exceeds the size limit).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Limits: up to <strong>{{ (upload_settings.max_batch if upload_settings else 100) | int }}</strong> files per batch and a maximum file size of <strong>{{ (upload_settings.max_file_mb if upload_settings else 10) | int }}</strong> MB.</li>
