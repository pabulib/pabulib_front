                <p class="text-justify mb-4">Pabulib is an open PArticipatory BUdgeting LIBrary. The aim of this website is
                    to collect the participatory budgeting data from all over the world. In a <a

                    we have introduced universal .pb data format in which we store all the files.</p>
                <p class="text-justify mb-6">We hope that Pabulib will foster meaningful research on PB, in particularly by
                    helping the computational social choice community to offer better aggregation methods to be used in
                    real-world instances of PB.</p>

                <p class="text-justify mb-6">The Jagiellonian Center for Quantitative Research in Political Science (CBIP) is
                    an interdisciplinary research center focusing on the intersection of mathematics, computer science,
                    and political science, ranging from classic and computational social choice theory, through
                    mathematical modeling of elections and voting, to the application of machine learning and data
                    mining algorithms to political science problems such as detection of gerrymandering or
                    identification of voting patterns. The Center's research team includes mathematicians, computer
                    scientists, political scientists, physicists, sociologists, lawyers, and geographers. In addition to
                    research, the Center also develops and maintains database resources for researchers working on
                    electoral systems, legislative studies, and political parties.</p>
